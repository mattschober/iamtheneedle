## What is SEO for AI?

**SEO for AI** is the practice of optimizing content and digital presence so that AI systems (like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini) can accurately recognize, understand, and surface information about individuals and organizations.

Unlike traditional SEO (which focuses on search engine algorithms), **SEO for AI** focuses on large language models and how they build entity associations.
